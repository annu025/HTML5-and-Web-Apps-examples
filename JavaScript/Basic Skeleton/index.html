      the browser displays the page in a top-down fashion, creating the DOM elements as 
      it comes across them in the HTML document. 
      By placing the <script> tags at the end, the JavaScript files will be one of the 
      last things the page loads. Because JavaScript files are often very large and 
      take a bit of time to load, we like to do that last so that the user will get 
      visual feedback from the other elements as fast as possible.
